	abstract = {A genetic algorithm controlled multispot transmitter is proposed as an alternative approach to optimizing the power distribution for single element receivers in fully diffuse mobile indoor optical wireless communication systems. By specifically tailoring the algorithm, it is shown that by dynamically altering the intensity of individual diffusion spots, a consistent power distribution, with negligible impact on bandwidth and rms delay spread, can be created in multiple rooms independent of reflectivity characteristics and user movement patterns. This advantageous adaptability removes the need for bespoke system design, aiming instead for the use of a more cost effective, optimal transmitter and receiver capable of deployment in multiple scenarios and applications. From the simulations conducted it is deduced, that implementing a receiver with a FOV=55deg in conjunction with either of two notable algorithms, the dynamic range of the rooms, referenced against the peak received power, can be reduced by up to 26\% when empty, and furthermore to within 12\% of this optimized case when user movement perturbs the channel.},

IEEE 802.11ax was launched in May 2014 with the goal of enhancing throughput-per-area in high-density scenarios. The first 802.11ax draft versions, namely, D1.0 and D2.0, were released at the end of 2016 and 2017. Focusing on a more mature version D3.0, in this tutorial paper, we help the reader to smoothly enter into the several major 802.11ax breakthroughs, including a brand new orthogonal frequency-division multiple access-based random access approach as well as novel spatial frequency reuse techniques. In addition, this tutorial will highlight selected significant improvements (including physical layer enhancements, multi-user multiple input multiple output extensions, power saving advances, and so on) which make this standard a very significant step forward with respect to its predecessor 802.11ac.},

In this paper, a real-time VLP system with low positioning latency and high positioning accuracy is proposed. With the lightweight image processing algorithm, the proposed system can be implemented on low-cost embedded system and support real-time accurate indoor positioning for mobile units with a fast moving speed. Experimental results show that the proposed system implemented on a Raspberry Pi can achieve a positioning accuracy of 3.93 cm and support the moving speed up to 38.5 km/h.},

	abstract = {An ad hoc network is a collection of wireless mobile hosts forming a temporary network without the aid of any established infrastructure or centralized administration. In such an environment, it may be necessary for one mobile host to enlist the aid of other hosts in forwarding a packet to its destination, due to the limited range of each mobile host’s wireless transmissions. This paper presents a protocol for routing in ad hoc networks that uses dynamic source routing. The protocol adapts quickly to routing changes when host movement is frequent, yet requires little or no overhead during periods in which hosts move less frequently. Based on results from a packet-level simulation of mobile hosts operating in an ad hoc network, the protocol performs well over a variety of environmental conditions such as host density and movement rates. For all but the highest rates of host movement simulated, the overhead of the protocol is quite low, falling to just 1\% of total data packets transmitted for moderate movement rates in a network of 24 mobile hosts. In all cases, the difference in length between the routes used and the optimal route lengths is negligible, and in most cases, route lengths are on average within a factor of 1.01 of optimal.},

	abstract = {Hybrid light fidelity (LiFi) and wireless fidelity (WiFi) networks (HLWNets) have been recently proposed as a promising technique for indoor wireless communications. Such a network combines the high-speed transmission of LiFi and the ubiquitous coverage of WiFi. Meanwhile, in addition to user mobility, intermittent light-path blockages make the handover issue intricate in HLWNets. Also, load balancing (LB) is necessary because the coverage areas of LiFi and WiFi networks are completely overlapped. This further increases the difficulty in handover as the decision for a vertical or a horizontal handover in a mobile environment with ultra-small cells is non-trival. Aimed at providing an optimal solution to the access point selection (APS) with given channel state information (CSI), the conventional LB method might cause frequent and unnecessary handovers. In this paper, a joint optimisation problem is formulated to simultaneously consider LB and handover in HLWNets. Results show that compared with the conventional LB method, the proposed method can improve the system throughput by up to 60\%.},

With the help of a prediction algorithm, we demonstrated real-time localization with a {\textless}; 4mm tracking error. Furthermore, we propose and evaluate experimentally hard and soft handover mechanisms to support inter-cell user mobility.

Extracting meaningful and important location points from massive trajectory data for clustering, an improved hidden Markov model is used to predict the user’s next location by analyzing the patterns of the user’s historical mobile trajectory data. The Q-learning algorithm is then used to determine the optimal network handover based on the current network state, while a seamless handover protocol is introduced to ensure successful network transition and uninterrupted data transmission. Compared with the traditional STD-LTE handover scheme, the proposed algorithm can reduce vertical handover rates by up to 32\% during fast walking.

Because of deploying narrow optical beams, the BS-ILC system requires efficient mobility management to support mobile user devices. This study develops a new BS-ILC model based on the Gaussian beam propagation that precisely estimates the user device's received signal strength from its localized position.

	abstract = {The hybrid LiFi/WiFi communication networks have demonstrated their efficacy and advantages in terms of data transmission rates. Multiple difficulties were identified in these networks, including the access point assignment (APA) and the process of handover (HO). These troubles (criteria) are influenced by multiple elements, including optical gain at the recipient, mobility, distance, blockage, shadowing, and other variables. It is crucial to evaluate multiple criteria when making-decisions in order to attain more precise results. However, as far, limited studies employing the multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) technique for a hybrid LiFi/WiFi network has been discovered. Nevertheless, although the MCDM technique is highly accurate, it involves long process to achieve the optimal access point (AP). This results in heightened complexity of the system, leading to longer AP transfer times and higher HO rates. In order to address the aforementioned constraints, this paper introduces a novel approach termed as card-flipping decision making (CFDM). CFDM enables swift and precise decision-making while minimizing computational complexity. Additionally, it incorporates HO rates that involve bypassing HOs and selecting the most optimal AP. The analytic hierarchy process (AHP) is adopted to estimate the subjective weights of each criterion and establish their level of priority. The proposed method provided in this study is combined with the AHP, referred to as the merged AHP-CFDM. This integration is considered a new MCDM technique. The proposed method consists of an algorithm that performs i) criteria segmentation based on criteria values, ii) criteria sortation based on AHP results, and iii) criteria grouping based on network type. The classification of criteria is also taken into account including cost and benefit criteria. The proposed algorithm treats each criterion as a card, and each card is flipped (computed) when necessary. The outcome of the AHP-CFDM decisions are SKIP, FLIP, and ASSIGN. The proposed AHP-CFDM is a new MCDM technique and can be utilized in other networks and/or applications for decision-making. The investigation demonstrates improvements in total system efficiency in terms of computational complexity and HO rates when compared to both standard approaches and benchmark techniques. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed strategy outperforms other methods significantly when compared to the most relevant studies.},

Nevertheless, the nonlinear channel impairments restrict the overall system performance and have not been fully considered in the association structure designing. In this paper, an adaptive user association approach within the UC-cells formation of dense VLC networks is investigated under the consideration of practical nonlinear impairments and adjacent interference. It is mathematically formulated to be an achievable data rate maximization problem by coordinately determining the optimal candidates of access point, clipping ratio and information-carrying power. We divide this mixed combinatorial and non-convex optimization problem into two subproblems and delicately transform them to be binary nonlinear programming and constrained linear programming problems, respectively. In addition, we develop an efficient approach to obtain the local optimal solution with low-computational complexity in an alternating iterative way. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme has relatively fast convergence and shows robustness to the variation of complex interference patterns and nonlinear impairments.

	abstract = {Load balancing (LB) is a key challenge in hybrid light fidelity (LiFi) and wireless fidelity (WiFi) networks (HLWNets), due to the nature of heterogeneous access points (APs). Machine learning has the potential to provide a complexity-friendly LB solution with near-optimal network performance, at the cost of a non-trivial training process. The state-of-the-art learning-aided LB methods require retraining when the network environment (particularly the user number) changes, significantly limiting their practicability. In this paper a novel deep neural network (DNN) structure, named adaptive target-condition neural network (A-TCNN), is proposed to tackle the LB issue for a varying number of users, without the need for retraining. Unlike the existing LB methods conducting AP selection for all users together, the new method performs AP selection for a single target user, upon the condition of other users. Also, A-TCNN involves an adaptive mechanism which maps any smaller number of users to a preset number by splitting the users’ data rate requirements, without affecting the AP selection result for the target user. Once trained, A-TCNN can be used for any user numbers not exceeding the maximum user number that the network can support. Results show that apart from the adaptiveness to a varying user number, A-TCNN provides a higher network throughput (up to 45\%) than the conventional DNN in most cases, especially for a larger scale of network. In terms of computational complexity, A-TCNN can achieve a sub-millisecond level runtime, which is 2 orders of magnitude lower than fuzzy logic and 3 orders of magnitude lower than game theory.},

Additionally, employing higher frequency bands (mm Wave, THz, and optical spectrum) beyond sub-6 GHz is essential, yet it presents significant challenges. Poor propagation abilities and ultra-small cells of these higher-frequency networks amplify the complexity of mobility management. Therefore, devising an efficient hand over scheme for future ultra-dense 6G heterogeneous networks, capable of addressing these challenges and ensuring rapid response for loT devices, is of paramount importance. To address these challenges, we exemplify with the hybrid LiFi and WiFi network, which is regarded as a potential component for 6G heterogeneous networks, proposing an unsupervised learning-based handover scheme. Our simulations show that this scheme matches or surpasses benchmark performances in terms of user throughput, handover rate, and delay, while minimising computational complexity. Consequently, our approach effectively addresses the distinctive demands of future 6G loT environments.},

In this work, we present a solution to this problem by developing a predictive vertical handoff algorithm between Light Fidelity (Li-Fi) and Wireless Fidelity (Wi-Fi) networks. By using a state-of-the-art machine learning based forecasting model, our handoff algorithm predicts the number of time intervals for which blockage will occur in the next time block. Based on this prediction, our algorithm proactively hands off from Li-Fi to Wi-Fi and from Wi-Fi to Li-Fi in a manner that trades off the Average Available Data Rate (AADR) and the percentage service interruption. We demonstrate the performance of our algorithm on data collected in a life simulation environment in which humans move about in an indoor setting and block Li-Fi links. We show that our algorithm maintains a high AADR while achieving a very low percentage service interruption. Furthermore, we show that by varying the values of the parameters of our algorithm, we can achieve a gradual trade-off between AADR and the percentage service interruption. Our algorithm paves the way to high-performance hybrid Li-Fi/Wi-Fi networks that bear the potential to significantly change the landscape of indoor communication in the near future.},

However, due to the susceptible line-of-sight propagation of optical signal and the ultra-dense deployment of LiFi access points, the handover problem in the HLWNet becomes challenging and it is hard to design a handover scheme that adapts to complex indoor working scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel handover scheme, in which the handover events in HLWNet are classified into three categories and a particular strategy for each category is applied to calculate the optimal dwell time in the handover procedure. The proposed handover scheme is adaptive to different working situations, since the information about multiple attributes, such as channel quality, user velocity, and arrivals data rate, is gathered to make the handover decision and to calculate the dwell value. The simulation results show that, compared to the benchmarks, the proposed method is able to increase the user throughput by around 65\%, decrease the handover rate by up to 80\%, and reduce the packet delay by up to 57\%. In addition, the proposed method significantly improves the robustness performance of user throughput and handover rate under different scenarios.},

Our BS-ILC system uses a wavelength domain where each wavelength covers one wireless cell. A camera-based localization determines the position of user devices relative to access points. With the help of a prediction algorithm, we demonstrated real-time localization with a {\textless}; 4mm tracking error. Furthermore, we propose and evaluate experimentally hard and soft handover mechanisms to support inter-cell user mobility.

However, the susceptibility of light to user mobility hinders its wide adoption. Hence, the coexistence of RF and light-based wireless communications has the potential to offer seamless heterogeneous network (HetNet) coverage through intelligent vertical handover policies in the presence of users' mobility. In this article, we first present new insights on the implementation of realistic indoor mobile optical channels and the impact of crowd mobility on relevant channel statistics. Then, an artificial intelligence (AI)-based framework for efficient resource management in mobile multi-user RF-light HetNets is proposed using a deep learning-empowered optical link predictor and a multiagent reinforcement learning-based link assignment strategy. The proposed AI-based framework helps to lay down the foundations of smart resource management in mobile multi-user HetNets.},

Meanwhile, the handover issue in hybrid networks becomes a hotspot since the coverage areas of LiFi and WiFi overlap each other. In addition, LiFi may cause frequent handovers for fast-moving users, while WiFi is susceptible to traffic overload. Consequently, the selection between LiFi and WiFi becomes a tricky problem. In this paper we propose a novel handover scheme, which adopts a dynamic coefficient via machine learning to adjust the selection preference between LiFi and WiFi. The new method balances channel quality, resource availability and user mobility to make handover decisions. Results show that compared to the received signal strength (RSS)-based and trajectory-based handover methods, the proposed scheme can improve the user's throughput by up to 260\% and 50\%, respectively.},

	abstract = {This work investigates handover in hybrid light fidelity (LiFi) and wireless fidelity (WiFi) networks (HLWNets). In such a network, the handover process becomes challenging due to two main factors: i) the relatively short coverage range of a single access point (AP), and ii) the largely overlapping coverage areas of different networks. As a result, HLWNets are susceptible to frequent handovers. To reduce the handover rate, the concept of handover skipping (HS) was introduced, which enables handovers between non-adjacent APs. However, conventional HS methods rely on knowledge about the user's trajectory, which is not readily available at the AP. In this paper, a novel HS scheme is proposed on the basis of reference signal received power (RSRP) and its rate of change, with an adaptive network preference adopted. Since RSRP is commonly used in the existing handover schemes, the proposed method requires no additional signalling between the user and the AP. Simulation results show that the new method can effectively reduce unnecessary handovers, especially those between LiFi and WiFi. Compared to the standard and trajectory-based handover schemes, the proposed method improves network throughput by up to about 120\% and 30\%, respectively.},

While such a network can boost the system capacity, it faces a challenging issue in handover since the coverage areas of LiFi and WiFi completely overlap each other. Also, LiFi has a relatively short coverage range from a single access point (AP). As a result, HLWNets are susceptible to frequent handovers, in terms of both handovers between LiFi and WiFi and handovers between two LiFi APs. Therefore handover skipping was introduced, which enables handovers between two non-adjacent APs. Conventional handover skipping schemes rely on knowledge about the user's trajectory, and are difficult to implement in practice. Alternatively, the rate of change in reference signal received power (RSRP) can be used to reflect the user's moving direction. Based on this, an adaptive handover scheme is proposed in this paper, which varies the user's network preference according to the user's speed.

For example, LoRaWAN communications have been widely used in IoT applications, being an attractive solution due to their long-range coverage, low implementation cost, and higher autonomy.

The paper studies this impact by using field tests employing one LoRa node with an omnidirectional antenna in an outdoor parking lot with vegetation. The tests use four LoRa gateways located in the corners of the area to measure the signals with and without body obstruction. The node was located on the subject’s chest to maximize signal obstruction. Results show that signal strength decreases by an average of 3 dB on links with body shadowing. Additionally, the study uses these signals with machine learning and Kalman filter localization algorithms. Finally, the results show that body shadowing affects location accuracy in most methods.

	abstract = {The learning rate is one of the most crucial hyper-parameters to regulate during the training of the Deep Learning (DL) models and optimizers. Adaptive learning rate algorithms try to automate the time-consuming process of manually setting a suitable learning rate, which is still exhausting. This research uses the learn rate schedule mechanism for training DL models. The learn rate schedule mechanism updates the learning rate for each step or iteration in DL models and optimizers for problem-solving. This paper implements a learn rate schedule mechanism and hybrid learn rate schedule mechanism like piecewise, exponential decay, polynomial time, reciprocal time and cosine annealing decay as adaptive learning rate mechanisms for DL models and optimizers like Adadelta, Adam, RMSprop and Stochastic Gradient Descent with Momentum (SGDM) to improve the accuracy of Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI)-based localization in LoRaWAN (Long Range Wide Area Networks) based Internet of Things (IoT) networks. These techniques aim to automate the process of determining suitable learning rates that dynamically update the learning rate for each step or iteration for optimizers and deep learning models. This technique improves the model’s performance by introducing adaptability into the learning process and departing from conventional set learning rates. The mathematical model of the learning rate schedule is derived and formulated with adaptive deep learning rate models to map with the LoRaWAN RSSI-based localization datasets for accessing the performance parameters. The learn rate schedule for different types of localization datasets is also analyzed. The results were compared for all the learning rate schedule mechanisms with the default parameter settings of DL models, and it gives a better accuracy of 98.98\%, which is higher than the existing models.},

Therefore, we propose an interpolation-based approach to densify sparse datasets acquired from a limited number of measurements. We demonstrate that the proposed approach can accurately model the signal levels of the serving base station (BS) and predict the coverage by neighboring cells. With the best performing linear and Kriging interpolation algorithms, we achieved values of mean absolute error under 3 dB. Specifically, both methods achieved a prediction error of less than 5 dB for more than 80 \% of the measurement points. The prediction accuracy was nearly constant over the entire range of separation distances between the BSs and end devices. Owing to the minimal need for parameterization of the input dataset, the proposed solution is significantly less computationally demanding than machine learning (ML)-based approaches, and does not require training-validation cycles.},

	abstract = {Wireless technology has emerged as a pivotal enabler of modernization across various domains, significantly transforming the landscape of communication and connectivity. The advent of the Internet of Things (IoT) has catalyzed this transformation, introducing a myriad of innovative solutions that leverage different Radio-Frequency (RF) protocols. Among these, Long Range (LoRa) has emerged as a leading contender, distinguished by its utilization of the Industrial, Scientific, and Medical (ISM) band, its low power consumption, and its extended range capabilities. These attributes have positioned LoRa at the forefront of IoT communication, demonstrating its versatility and effectives across a wide range of applications. This study undertaken a comparative analysis of LoRa signal propagation in Indoor-to-“Indoor (I2I) and Outdoor-to-Outdoor (O2O) environments, specifically focusing on signal attenuation. The research is conducted at VIT University, Andhra Pradesh, and involves a case study that examines the performance of LoRa in both indoor and outdoor settings. For the I2I scenario, the study measures received signal strength (RSSI) and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) over a distance of 72.9 meters between transmitter and receiver located on 8 floors building. In contrast, the O2O scenario assesses LoRa's performance over a distance of 1050 meters in an open ground environment, with RSSI and SNR of -129 and -10 respectively. The findings of this comparative study reveal that LoRa exhibits greater signal attenuation in indoor environments compared to outdoor settings, there by highlighting the technology's unique characteristics and potential applications in both indoor and outdoor communications scenarios.},

Localization is an essential tool that ensures preparedness, response, and coordination between first responders and impacted people. Many of these technologies employ artificial intelligence techniques to improve the localization accuracy using the information collected by a variety of sensing equipment such as sensors, unmanned aerial vehicles, wireless access points, cameras, and smart load meters. The paper also highlights the emerging sixth-generation (6G) wireless technologies such as integrated sensing and localization, THz communications, satellite-based non-terrestrial networks, and reconfigurable intelligent surfaces that can modify the reflection properties of materials to enable device localization. These technologies are expected to play a key role in enabling emergency services. Other localization technologies include WiFi, Bluetooth, radio frequency identification, and long range wide area network. In addition, crowd sensing and smart meter-based non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) techniques that are supported by deep learning and federated learning techniques are also presented in the context of device localization. To the best of our knowledge, this paper introduces NILM for the first time as a useful technique that can provide information about the inhabitants’ behaviour in residential and commercial buildings to assist in emergency and public safety applications. All the technologies reviewed in this paper can play an effective role in device localization, and are presented to serve as a foundation for researchers to further investigate and conduct research in this domain.},

	abstract = {Optical wireless communication (OWC) is considered to be a promising technology which will alleviate traffic burden caused by the increasing number of mobile devices. In this study, a novel vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser (VCSEL) array is proposed for indoor OWC systems. To activate the best beam for a mobile user, two beam activation methods are proposed for the system. The method based on a corner-cube retroreflector (CCR) provides very low latency and allows real-time activation for high-speed users. The other method uses the omnidirectional transmitter (ODTx). The ODTx can serve the purpose of uplink transmission and beam activation simultaneously. Moreover, systems with ODTx are very robust to the random orientation of a user equipment (UE). System level analyses are carried out for the proposed VCSEL array system. For a single user scenario, the probability density function (PDF) of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for the central beam of the VCSEL array system can be approximated as a uniform distribution. In addition, the average data rate of the central beam and its upper bound are given analytically and verified by Monte-Carlo simulations. For a multi-user scenario, an analytical upper bound for the average data rate is given. The effects of the cell size and the full width at half maximum (FWHM) angle on the system performance are studied. The results show that the system with a FWHM angle of 4° outperforms the others.},

	abstract = {The development of high-speed and high-brightness vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs), which can serve as an efficient light source for optical wireless communication (OWC), play a crucial role in growth of the next generation of wireless communication networks, e.g., 6 G and satellite communications. In this work, by optimizing the size of the Zn-diffusion and oxide-relief apertures in a high-speed 850 nm VCSEL, we obtain record-high brightness (2.9 MW {\textbackslash}mathrm cm{\textasciicircum}-2{\textbackslash}mathrm sr{\textasciicircum}-1 at 10 mW output) with single polarized and (quasi-) single-mode (SM) outputs under continuous wave (CW) operation. However, such high brightness output comes at the cost of spatial hole burning (SHB) effect and degraded quality of 25 Gbit/sec eye patterns. In addition, an SM VSCEL array structure is usually needed to further boost the total available optical power for long-reach OWC. Here, a novel (quasi-) SM VCSEL array structure is demonstrated which releases the trade-off between the performances of brightness and eye-pattern quality. Our demonstrated array has a special crisscross mesa connecting neighboring VCSEL units and an extra electroplated copper substrate integrated on the backside of the chip. Compared to the reference array without the copper substrate and connected active mesas, the demonstrated array exhibits a higher (quasi-) SM output power, narrower divergence angle, larger orthogonal polarization mode suppression ratio (OPSR), and flatter E-O response. This in turn leads to smaller jitter and less noise in the measured 12.5 Gbit/sec eye-patterns. The demonstrated 7{\textbackslash}times 7 array exhibits a maximum SM power of around 90 mW with a 1/ {\textbackslash}texte{\textasciicircum}2 divergence angle as narrow as 7o (FWHM: 5o), single polarized output (10 dB OPSR), decent relative intensity noise performance ({\textless}−130 dB/Hz) and clear 12.5 Gbit/sec eye-opening. Such new device with remarkable static/dynamic performances has strong potential to further improve the product of the linking distance and data rate in the next generation of OWC channels.},

The high-capacity downlink based on a single-pixel quantum dot (QD) micro-LED can reach a data rate of 2.74 Gbps with adaptive orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM). VCSEL-based line-of-sight (LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) uplinks are designed with lens-free receiving functions for a 2.2-m communication distance. Experimental results have been demonstrated and confirmed that both downlink and uplinks are capable of providing sufficient bandwidth for a multi-gigabit OWC. Besides, the lens-free uplink receiver can alleviate requirements for aligning and improve the mobility of the transmitter. The VCSELs implemented for both systems work with low driving currents of 140-mA and 190-mA under consideration of the human eye safety. For non-return-to-zero on-off keying (NRZ-OOK), both uplinks can achieve 2.125 Gbps with bit-error-rate (BER) lower than the forward error correction (FEC) threshold of 3.8\&\#x00D7;10\&\#x2212;3 for Ethernet access.},

The proposed design combines direct current optical orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (DCO-OFDM) and a spatial multiplexing MIMO architecture. For such an ultra-high-speed line-of-sight (LOS) OWC link with low divergence laser beams, maintaining alignment is of high importance. In this paper, two types of misalignment error between the transmitter and receiver are distinguished, namely, radial displacement error and orientation angle error, and they are thoroughly modeled in a unified analytical framework assuming Gaussian laser beams, resulting in a generalized misalignment model (GMM). The derived GMM is then extended to MIMO arrays and the performance of the MIMO-OFDM OWC system is analyzed in terms of the aggregate data rate. Novel insights are provided into the system performance based on computer simulations by studying various influential factors such as beam waist, array configuration and different misalignment errors, which can be used as guidelines for designing short range Tb/s MIMO OWC systems.},

The large current-bandwidth capability of the laser driver is enabled by a distributed current driver design utilizing three enhanced-mode pseudomorphic high electron mobility transistors.

We present systematic design and thorough analytical modeling of the AP architecture, which are then applied to downlink system modeling using non-imaging angle diversity receivers (ADRs). We propose static beam clustering with coordinated multi-beam joint transmission (CoMB-JT) for network interference management and devise various clustering strategies to address inter-beam interference (IBI) and inter-cluster interference (ICI). Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) schemes are also adopted to handle intra-cluster interference, and the resulting signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) and achievable data rate are derived. The network performance is studied in terms of spatial distributions and statistics of the downlink SINR and data rate through extensive computer simulations. The results demonstrate that data rates up to 15 Gb/s are achieved within the coverage area and a properly devised clustering strikes a balance between the sum rate and fairness depending on the number of users.},

The objective is to realize data rates in excess of 1 Tb/s for the backhaul of next generation indoor networks. The proposed design combines direct current optical orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (DCO-OFDM) with spatial multiplexing to attain the target data rate subject to eye safety limitations. Following a bottom-up approach, the signal-to-interference-plus-noise (SINR) per channel is modeled using a Gaussian emission profile for laser beams by taking into account crosstalk in the MIMO channel. According to the SINR expression, the aggregate data rate is derived. The performance of the system is studied using computer simulations, and insightful remarks are provided on the configuration of various system parameters including the beam waist, the MIMO size and array dimensions.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, the flexible localization solution for various devices for workplace safety is one of the most demanding research questions. Notably, it is expected to provide an acceptable level of precision in different types of environments empowered by wearable technology and Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices. Existing leading localization technologies are adapted for certain conditions, for example, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth low energy (BLE), and ultra-wideband (UWB) are used for indoor areas and various global navigation satellite system (GNSS)-based ones for outdoors. This work focuses on investigating the long-range wide-area network (LoRaWAN) (868-MHz band) as a potential candidate to bridge this gap, being one of the most reliable and recognized communication technologies for the Industrial IoT (IIoT). In the past, the research community had a lot of critics with respect to the applicability of LoRaWAN for localization, while the vision is facing tremendous change over the past two years. The purpose of this work is to assess the feasibility of LoRaWAN as a localization solution for work safety applications in the industrial scenario from different angles. The work is based on two measurement campaigns conducted at the Brno University of Technology (BUT), Brno, Czech Republic, and the University Politechnica of Bucharest (UPB), Bucharest, Romania. The campaigns cover both indoor and outdoor scenarios and provide the practical limitations of the positioning in standalone and k -nearest neighbors ( k -NN) powered localization systems. According to the results, LoRaWAN-based localization with relatively dense gateways (GWs) deployment allows for achieving a meter-level accuracy, which may be suitable for the localization of workers.},

Global Positioning System (GPS) chips have high cost and power consumption, making it unsuitable for long-range (LoRa) and low-power IoT devices. Alternatively, low-power wide-area (LPWA) signals can be used for simultaneous positioning and communication. We summarize previous studies related to LoRa signal-based positioning systems, including those addressing proximity, a path loss model, time difference of arrival (TDoA), and fingerprint positioning methods. We propose a LoRa signal-based positioning method that uses a fingerprint algorithm instead of a received signal strength indicator (RSSI) proximity or TDoA method. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the accuracy and usability of the fingerprint algorithm for large areas in the real world. We estimated the locations using probabilistic means based on three different algorithms that use interpolated fingerprint RSSI maps. The average accuracy of the three proposed algorithms in our experiments was 28.8 m. Our method also reduced the battery consumption significantly compared with that of existing GPS-based positioning methods.},

In order to evaluate fingerprinting in large outdoor environments, extensive, time-consuming measurement campaigns need to be conducted to create useful datasets. This paper presents three LPWAN datasets which are collected in large-scale urban and rural areas. The goal is to provide the research community with a tool to evaluate fingerprinting algorithms in large outdoor environments. During a period of three months, numerous mobile devices periodically obtained location data via a GPS receiver which was transmitted via a Sigfox or LoRaWAN message. Together with network information, this location data is stored in the appropriate LPWAN dataset. The first results of our basic fingerprinting implementation, which is also clarified in this paper, indicate a mean location estimation error of 214.58 m for the rural Sigfox dataset, 688.97 m for the urban Sigfox dataset and 398.40 m for the urban LoRaWAN dataset. In the future, we will enlarge our current datasets and use them to evaluate and optimize our fingerprinting methods. Also, we intend to collect additional datasets for Sigfox, LoRaWAN and NB-IoT.},

	abstract = {The increasing number of mobile devices challenges the current radio frequency (RF) networks, e.g. wireless fidelity (WiFi) networks. Light Fidelity (LiFi) is considered as a promising complementary technology, which operates within the visible light spectrum and infrared spectrum. In an indoor scenario, a hybrid LiFi/WiFi network (HLWN) provides a potential solution to future wireless communications where LiFi augments WiFi in providing ultra-high speed and low latency wireless connectivity. In this paper, dynamic load balancing (LB) with handover in HLWNs is studied. The orientation-based random waypoint (ORWP) mobility model is considered to provide a more realistic framework to evaluate the performance of HLWNs. Based on the low-pass filtering effect of the LiFi channel, we firstly propose an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing access (OFDMA)-based resource allocation (RA) method in LiFi systems. Also, an enhanced evolutionary game theory (EGT)-based LB scheme with handover in HLWNs is proposed. In the EGT scheme, each user adapts their strategy to improve the payoff until LB is achieved across LiFi and WiFi. Then, the LiFi system uses the proposed OFDMA-based RA method while the WiFi system applies the carrier sense multiple access with collision detection (CSMA/CA). Simulation results show that in the LiFi system the OFDMA-based RA scheme outperforms the time division multiple access (TDMA) scheme in terms of both user data rate and fairness. Regarding LB in HLWNs, the proposed EGT scheme can achieve a remarkable enhancement in throughput compared to benchmark schemes, such as hard threshold (HT) scheme and random access point assignment (RAA) scheme.},

However, due to the susceptible line-of-sight propagation of optical signal and the ultra-dense deployment of LiFi access points, the handover problem in the HLWNet becomes challenging and it is hard to design a handover scheme that adapts to complex indoor working scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel handover scheme, in which the handover events in HLWNet are classified into three categories and a particular strategy for each category is applied to calculate the optimal dwell time in the handover procedure. The proposed handover scheme is adaptive to different working situations, since the information about multiple attributes, such as channel quality, user velocity, and arrivals data rate, is gathered to make the handover decision and to calculate the dwell value. The simulation results show that, compared to the benchmarks, the proposed method is able to increase the user throughput by around 65\%, decrease the handover rate by up to 80\%, and reduce the packet delay by up to 57\%. In addition, the proposed method significantly improves the robustness performance of user throughput and handover rate under different scenarios.},

	abstract = {Hybrid light fidelity (LiFi) and wireless fidelity (WiFi) networks are a promising paradigm of heterogeneous network (HetNet), attributed to the complementary physical properties of optical spectra and radio frequency. However, the current development of such HetNets is mostly bottlenecked by the existing transmission control protocol (TCP), which restricts the user equipment (UE) to connecting one access point (AP) at a time. While the ongoing investigation on multipath TCP (MPTCP) can bring significant benefits, it complicates the network topology of HetNets, making the existing load balancing (LB) learning models less effective. Driven by this, we propose a graph neural network (GNN)-based model to tackle the LB problem for MPTCP-enabled HetNets, which results in a partial mesh topology. Such a topology can be modeled as a graph, with the channel state information and data rate requirement embedded as node features, while the LB solutions are deemed as edge labels. Compared to the conventional deep neural network (DNN), the proposed GNN-based model exhibits two key strengths: i) it can better interpret a complex network topology; and ii) it can handle various numbers of APs and UEs with a single trained model. Simulation results show that against the traditional optimisation method, the proposed learning model can achieve near-optimal throughput within a gap of 11.5\%, while reducing the inference time by 4 orders of magnitude. In contrast to the DNN model, the new method can improve the network throughput by up to 21.7\%, at a similar inference time level.},

	abstract = {A Hybrid LiFi and WiFi network (HLWNet) integrates the rapid data transmission capabilities of Light Fidelity (LiFi) with the extensive connectivity provided by Wireless Fidelity (WiFi), resulting in significant benefits for wireless data transmissions in the designated area. However, the challenge of decision-making during the handover process in HLWNet is made more complex due to the specific characteristics of electromagnetic signals’ line-of-sight transmission, resulting in a greater level of intricacy compared to previous heterogeneous networks. This research work addresses the problem of handover decisions in the Hybrid LiFi and WiFi networks and treats it as a binary classification problem. Consequently, it proposes a handover method based on a deep neural network (DNN). The comprehensive handover scheme incorporates two sets of neural networks (ANN and DNN) that utilize input factors such as channel quality and the mobility of users to enable informed decisions during handovers. Following training with labeled datasets, the neural-network-based handover approach achieves an accuracy rate exceeding 95\%. A comparative analysis of the proposed scheme against the benchmark reveals that the proposed method considerably increases user throughput by approximately 18.58\% to 38.5\% while reducing the handover rate by approximately 55.21\% to 67.15\% compared to the benchmark artificial neural network (ANN); moreover, the proposed method demonstrates robustness in the face of variations in user mobility and channel conditions.},

	abstract = {Optical wireless communication (OWC) is a strong candidate in the sixth generation (6G) of wireless communications as it can support data transmission at high communication speeds, low power consumption, high security, and high reliability. Near-infrared lasers, specifically vertical cavity surface emitting lasers (VCSELs), exhibit larger modulation bandwidth compared to light-emitting diodes (LEDs), and can provide aggregate data rates ranging up to Terabit per second (Tbps). This chapter proposes innovative optical transmitter and receiver designs for indoor laser-based wireless communications, aiming to provide seamless coverage in high-speed multi-user scenarios. The proposed optical transmitter is based on a 5 × 5 VCSEL array where each VCSEL can provide 10 Gigabit per second (Gbps) in a uniform coverage area of 20 cm x 20 cm, achieving a total of 250 Gbps in an area of 1 m2 at 3 m transmission distance. Moreover, two wide-FOV receiver designs that employ photodetector (PD) arrays in along with imaging or non-imaging optics are introduced to support such an ultra-high-speed optical link. The new design of OWC requires potential techniques to address various networking challenges, including cell formation, interference management, resource allocation, and backhauling. To this end, potential solutions for these challenges are discussed to help establish an end-to-end OWC infrastructure for practical deployment.},

	abstract = {Load balancing (LB) is a challenging issue in the hybrid light fidelity (LiFi) and wireless fidelity (WiFi) networks (HLWNets), due to the nature of heterogeneous access points (APs). Machine learning has the potential to provide a complexity-friendly LB solution with near-optimal network performance, at the cost of a training process. The state-of-the-art (SOTA) learning-aided LB methods, however, need retraining when the network environment (especially the number of users) changes, significantly limiting its practicability. In this paper, a novel deep neural network (DNN) structure named adaptive target-condition neural network (A-TCNN) is proposed, which conducts AP selection for one target user upon the condition of other users. Also, an adaptive mechanism is developed to map a smaller number of users to a larger number through splitting their data rate requirements, without affecting the AP selection result for the target user. This enables the proposed method to handle different numbers of users without the need for retraining. Results show that A-TCNN achieves a network throughput very close to that of the testing dataset, with a gap less than 3\%. It is also proven that A-TCNN can obtain a network throughput comparable to two SOTA benchmarks, while reducing the runtime by up to three orders of magnitude.},

Meanwhile, the handover issue in hybrid networks becomes a hotspot since the coverage areas of LiFi and WiFi overlap each other. In addition, LiFi may cause frequent handovers for fast-moving users, while WiFi is susceptible to traffic overload. Consequently, the selection between LiFi and WiFi becomes a tricky problem. In this paper we propose a novel handover scheme, which adopts a dynamic coefficient via machine learning to adjust the selection preference between LiFi and WiFi. The new method balances channel quality, resource availability and user mobility to make handover decisions. Results show that compared to the received signal strength (RSS)-based and trajectory-based handover methods, the proposed scheme can improve the user's throughput by up to 260\% and 50\%, respectively.},

Different handover schemes have been proposed to reduce the handover rate in HLWNets, among which handover skipping (HS) techniques stand out. However, existing solutions are still inefficient or require knowledge that is not available in practice, such as the exact user\&\#x2019;s trajectory or the network topology. In this work, a novel machine learning-based handover scheme is proposed to overcome the limitations of previous HS works. Specifically, we have designed a classification model to predict the type of user\&\#x2019;s trajectory and assist a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm to make handover decisions that are automatically adapted to new network conditions. The proposed scheme is called RL-HO, and we compare its performance against the standard handover scheme of long-term evolution (STD-LTE) and the so-called smart handover (Smart HO) algorithm. We show that our proposed RL-HO scheme improves the network throughput by 146\% and 59\% compared to STD-LTE and Smart HO, respectively. We make our simulator code publicly available to the research community.},

	abstract = {Laser-based optical wirele scommunication (OWC) can provide multi-Gb/s data rates for future indoor mobile wireless networks. However, due to the directionality of laser beams, the performance of indoor laser-based OWC suffers from the misalignment induced by the random orientation of user devices. To address this challenge, this work proposes the application of stabilizers at the user equipment to mitigate device orientation effects. Additionally, to support user mobility, we present a framework to optimally design receivers employing avalanche photodiode (APD) arrays, thereby providing a broad receiver field-of-view (FoV) while still upholding a wide bandwidth. Experimental measurements are conducted to assess the statistics of the random orientation angles of the user device across five practical movement types, both with and without stabilizers. Several analytical models are developed to precisely approximate the PDFs of the orientations in different scenarios, enabling performance evaluation of stabilizer-assisted OWC in the presence of misalignment. In addition, the trade-off between FoV, bandwidth, and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in the APD array-based receivers is analyzed. Based on this analysis, a receiver design algorithm is proposed, aimed at determining the optimal receiver configurations to maximize the achievable data rate given a desired FoV. Our simulation results, based on an indoor uplink high-speed OWC scenario, illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed system in mitigating the effects of misalignment, thereby decreasing the outage probability and enhancing the achievable data rate.},

	abstract = {Light fidelity (LiFi) is an emerging communication technology, which utilizes the light-emitting diodes (LEDs) for high-speed wireless communications. Due to its huge unlicensed bandwidth, LiFi is capable of supporting high data rates. The quality of the LiFi channel fluctuates across the room due to interference, reflection from walls or blockage. On the other hand, WiFi is another wireless communication technology that is capable of providing moderate data rates with ubiquitous coverage. As the electromagnetic spectrum of LiFi does not overlap with WiFi, both of them can coexist to form a hybrid LiFi and WiFi network for seamless and high-throughput connectivity. The performance of a hybrid system significantly depends upon the access point (AP) assignment and resource allocation strategies. In this paper, a downlink hybrid system with one WiFi AP and four LiFi APs is considered, and a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm is implemented in order to determine an optimal AP assignment strategy, which maximizes the long-term system throughput while ensuring the required users fairness and satisfaction. Furthermore, two different scenarios based on the random waypoint model with uniform and non-uniform distribution of users have been studied. The performance of the proposed system is compared against state-of-the-art benchmark approaches e.g., signal strength strategy (SSS), exhaustive search, and an iterative optimization method. The results are reported in terms of the average system throughput, user satisfaction, fairness, and capacity outage probability. It is shown that the proposed RL method performs closer to the exhaustive search scheme at fairly low complexity. The RL method also outperforms the SSS scheme and the iterative algorithm in most scenarios.},

Meanwhile, load balancing becomes a challenging issue due to a complete overlap between the coverage areas of LiFi and WiFi. User mobility and light-path blockages further complicate the process of load balancing, since the decision for a horizontal or a vertical handover in a mobile environment with ultra-small cells is non-trivial. These issues are managed separately in most conventional methods, which might cause frequent handovers and compromise throughput. A few studies address these issues jointly for selecting access points at each time instant but require excessive computational complexity. In this paper, a joint optimisation problem is formulated to determine a network-level selection for each user over a period of time. A novel algorithm based on fuzzy logic is also proposed to reduce the computational complexity that is required to solve the optimisation problem. Results show that compared to the conventional method, the proposed approach can improve system throughput by up to 68\%, while achieving very low computational complexity.},

	abstract = {Light Fidelity (LiFi) is a recently proposed technology that combines illumination and high speed wireless communication using light emitting diodes (LEDs). Since the used electromagnetic spectrum does not overlap with the radio frequency (RF) spectrum, a small cell LiFi attocell network can be added to the conventional RF network as an additional networking layer in order to mitigate the data traffic bottlenecks in high density environments. In such a hybrid LiFi/RF network where the LiFi attocell covers a few square meters, user movement may prompt frequent handovers, and the handover overhead would degrade the system throughput. The goal is to reduce the handover overhead by appropriately assigning users to either the RF or the LiFi access point (AP). In this study, a fuzzy logic (FL) based dynamic handover scheme is proposed. This FL scheme uses not only the channel state information (CSI), but also the user speed and desired data rate to determine whether a handover needs to be prompted. Simulation shows that the proposed scheme outperforms the conventional handover algorithms, and the performance improvement is approximately 40\% in terms of both data rate and user satisfaction level.},

This hybrid network combines the high-speed data transmission offered by visible light communication and the ubiquitous coverage of radio-frequency techniques. While a hybrid network can improve the system throughput and users' experience, it also challenges the process of access point selection (APS) due to the mixture of heterogeneous access points. In this paper, the differences between homogeneous and heterogeneous networks regarding APS are discussed, and a two-stage APS method is proposed for hybrid Li-Fi/Wi-Fi networks. In the first stage, a fuzzy logic system is developed to determine the users that should be connected to Wi-Fi. In the second stage, the remaining users are assigned in the environment of a homogeneous Li-Fi network. Compared with the optimisation method, the proposed method achieves a close-to-optimal throughput at significantly reduced complexity. Simulation results also show that our method greatly improves the system throughput over the conventional methods, such as the signal strength strategy and load balancing, at slightly increased complexity.},

Basically, a LiFi access point (AP) covers only a few square meters, enabling a dense deployment of LiFi APs to improve the network throughput. However, channel blockage and shadowing in conjunction with inter-cell interference compromise the connectivity and system throughput of LiFi networks. In this paper, a network structure that combines LiFi with the conventional radio frequency (RF) system is considered. Users experiencing strong blockages can be switched to the RF system to achieve a higher data rate. In this paper, blockages, random orientation of LiFi receivers, and the user data rate requirement are characterised to model a practical communication scenario. A novel load balancing (LB) scheme based on evolutionary game theory is proposed for hybrid LiFi/RF networks. The performance of the proposed scheme is comprehensively analyzed. Results show that compared to state-of-the-art LB algorithms, the proposed scheme greatly improves user satisfaction levels at reduced computational complexity. Also, an optimal orientation of LiFi receivers and blockage density in hybrid networks would maximize the users quality of service.},

	abstract = {As a promising complement to the increasingly congested wireless fidelity (WiFi) system, light fidelity (LiFi) has recently drawn massive attention due to the wide and unregulated visible light spectrum. Also, the light waves cannot penetrate walls which enables interference avoidance between compartments. Meanwhile, LiFi access points (APs) have a much shorter range, relative to WiFi APs. A hybrid network can combine the high-speed transmission of LiFi and the ubiquitous coverage of WiFi. For such a network, access point assignment (APA) becomes challenging because of the completely overlaying coverage of different networks. In addition, LiFi is susceptible to channel blockage due to opaque obstacles, adding difficulties to the APA issue. In this paper, a novel APA method is proposed for hybrid LiFi and WiFi networks in consideration of LiFi channel blockage for the first time. By exploiting users' statistical information of channel blockage, the proposed method formulates the issue as an optimisation problem that maximises the system throughput over a period of time. Results show that the proposed method can improve throughput by up to 90\% over the conventional load balancing method.},

	abstract = {Visible light communication (VLC) is considered as a promising high speed wireless access technology. However, the line-of-sight (LOS) nature of visible light limits VLC coverage and user mobility. On the contrary, radio frequency (RF) provides much more extensive coverage, though its link bit rate is lower by contrast. A cooperation of VLC and RF can allow them to enhance each other in certain aspects. Therefore, following existing studies, a hybrid VLC-LTE system is employed. One big challenge for realizing such a heterogeneous network is mobility management due to dynamic traffic and network conditions. Based on two basic vertical handover (VHO) schemes, this paper proposes a VHO algorithm through prediction (PVHO). Interruption durations, message sizes and access delays are critical metrics for prejudging the system state. A mobile terminal (MT) records these key parameters in real time and then processes them to offer guidance for proper handover decisions. Through simulation, the advantages of PVHO are validated by comparing with existing algorithms. Analysis of the numeric results gives an indication that the performance of PVHO is superior under various circumstances.},

We formulate it as a Markov decision process problem and adopt a dynamic approach to obtain a trade-off between the switching cost and the delay requirement. The proposed scheme determines whether to perform VHO given the queue length and the condition of the optical wireless channel (available or unavailable). The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme is able to save about 50\% of the signaling cost of the VHO process without an obvious loss in system performance. Moreover, the proposed scheme is adaptable to different scenarios.},

	abstract = {This paper focuses on the handover probability as a result of the random rotation of a user equipment (UE) in hybrid light-fidelity (LiFi) and radio frequency (RF) networks. A received signal strength indicator (RSSI)-based handover algorithm is considered in this study. Using RSSI as the user association rule does not guarantee that the randomly-oriented UE is always associated with the nearest access point (AP). In some cases, depending on the orientation of the UE, the received signal powers from the LiFi APs are very weak and unreliable. Therefore, a vertical handover from the LiFi AP to the RF AP is required to maintain the user quality of service. Hence, it is essential to study the handover probability due to the change of orientation. A theoretical analysis of the handover probability based on a Markov chain model is provided. The analytical results are confirmed by the Monte Carlo simulation. The effects of some parameters, such as the threshold, hysteresis level and the trade-off between the frequency and the delay of handover are presented in this paper.},

In this paper, the impact of beam blockage due to a disc with varying size and distance from the receiver is studied where blockage is quantitatively evaluated using percentage blockage for 512 room locations at 25 cm separation. It was found that assigning two links with maximum separation between the serving access points can reduce or eliminate blockage compared to the case when resilience is not implemented.

Meanwhile, load balancing becomes a challenging issue due to a complete overlap between the coverage areas of LiFi and WiFi. User mobility and light-path blockages further complicate the process of load balancing, since the decision for a horizontal or a vertical handover in a mobile environment with ultra-small cells is non-trivial. These issues are managed separately in most conventional methods, which might cause frequent handovers and compromise throughput. A few studies address these issues jointly for selecting access points at each time instant but require excessive computational complexity. In this paper, a joint optimisation problem is formulated to determine a network-level selection for each user over a period of time. A novel algorithm based on fuzzy logic is also proposed to reduce the computational complexity that is required to solve the optimisation problem. Results show that compared to the conventional method, the proposed approach can improve system throughput by up to 68\%, while achieving very low computational complexity.},

Because signal path obstruction by furniture is easier to predict and avoid, we are mainly concerned with shadowing and blockage caused by people either sitting or standing. To avoid blockage of communication link by a user of portable units, maximum radiation angle at the transmitter in both configurations must not exceed 45/spl deg/. This restricts communication cell size. We show the probability of blockage of a cellular link depends almost linearly on the distance of the portable unit from the communication cell center. Unlike cellular links, MSD-MIMO links can be designed to be robust against blockage, though still vulnerable to shadowing. In a typical office having a height of 3 m, probability of shadowing is less than 2\% and in majority of cases shadowing causes less than 50\% reduction in the received signal power. Power penalty due to shadowing is insignificant (less than 0.1 dB) with a 1\% outage.},

Concerning indoor wireless services, a promising approach in this regard is to combine light fidelity (LiFi) and wireless fidelity (WiFi) technologies into a hybrid LiFi and WiFi network (HLWNet). Such a network benefits from LiFi’s distinct capability for high-speed data transmission and from the wide radio coverage offered by WiFi technologies. In this paper, we describe the framework for the HWLNet architecture, providing an overview of the handover methods used in HLWNets and presenting the basic architecture of hybrid LiFi/WiFi networks, optimization of cell deployment, relevant modulation schemes, illumination constraints, and backhaul device design. The survey also reviews the performance and recent achievements of HLWNets compared to legacy networks with an emphasis on signal to noise and interference ratio (SINR), spectral and power efficiency, and quality of service (QoS). In addition, user behaviour is discussed, considering interference in a LiFi channel is due to user movement, handover frequency, and load balancing. Furthermore, recent advances in indoor positioning and the security of hybrid networks are presented, and finally, directions of the hybrid network’s evolution in the foreseeable future are discussed.},

	abstract = {This paper describes a method for realizing the efficient utilization of wavelength resources in wavelength-division multiplexing networks with centralized light sources. Using a deeply saturated semiconductor optical amplifier (SOA) modulator located in a remote node (RN), we erase the data on a downstream signal with a low extinction ratio and modulate it with new data to generate an upstream signal. Thus, we use only one wavelength for bidirectional transmission between a center node and an RN, without placing lasers at the RN. In this paper, we analyze the data suppression characteristic of the SOA using a large signal model. We also estimate the bit error rate degradation in the presence of an unsuppressed downstream bit pattern in an upstream signal. We then report experimental results that confirm the basic characteristics of the wavelength channel data rewriter, which we constructed using a linear amplifier and an SOA. Finally, we provide the results of a data transmission experiment that we undertook using the data rewriter.},

	abstract = {The optical spectrum offers great opportunities to resolve the congestion in radio-based communication, aggravated by the booming demand for wireless connectivity. High-speed infrared optical components in the 1500 nm window have reached high levels of sophistication and are extensively used already in fibre-optic networks. Moreover, infrared light beyond 1400 nm is eye-safe and is not noticeable by the users. Deploying steerable narrow infrared beams, wireless links with huge capacity can be established to users individually, at minimum power consumption levels and at very high levels of privacy. Fully passive diffractive optical modules can handle many beams individually and accurately steer narrow beams two-dimensionally by just remotely tuning the wavelength of each beam. The system design aspects are discussed, encompassing the beam-steering transmitter, wide field-of-view optical receiver and the localization of the user's wireless devices. Prototype system demonstrators are reported, capable of supporting up to 128 beams carrying up to 112 Gbit s−1 per beam. Hybrid bidirectional systems which use a high-speed downstream optical link and an upstream radio link at a lower speed can provide powerful asymmetric wireless connections. All-optical bidirectional beam-steered wireless communication will be able to offer the ultimate in wireless capacity to the user while minimizing power consumption., This article is part of the theme issue ‘Optical wireless communication’.},

	abstract = {We have experimentally characterized nondirected indoor channels that use intensity modulation and direct detection of an infrared carrier at a wavelength of 832 nm. At several locations in each of five different rooms, we have studied line-of-sight and diffuse link configurations, with and without shadowing, amounting to a total of approximately 100 different channels. We have measured channel frequency responses over the 2-300 MHz range by using a swept-modulation frequency technique, and from these data, we have computed channel impulse responses, path losses and r.m.s. delay spreads. Using channel impulse responses, we have calculated power penalties induced by multipath intersymbol interference in baseband on-off-keyed links operating at bit rates of 10, 30 and 100 Mb/s, considering unequalized links and those employing zero-forcing decision-feedback equalization. Unshadowed line-of-sight configurations generally have smaller path losses, r.m.s. delay spreads and power penalties than their unshadowed diffuse counterparts. Shadowed line-of-sight configurations, however, generally exhibit larger values of all three parameters than the corresponding shadowed diffuse configurations. We show that among the channels measured here, there is a strong correspondence between channel r.m.s. delay spread and multipath power penalty. Finally, we provide an analysis indicating why non-directed infrared channels using intensity modulation and direct detection do not exhibit multipath fading, and justifying their representation as linear, time-invariant systems.{\textless}{\textgreater}},

Key path loss parameters such as the path loss exponent and the standard deviation of the shadowing component are determined for particular line-of-sight (LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) cases. A LOS path loss exponent of 1.92 and a shadowing standard deviation of 0.81 dB are obtained.

In this paper we present an innovative design for the operation of such ad-hoc networks. The basic idea of the design is to operate each Mobile Host as a specialized router, which periodically advertises its view of the interconnection topology with other Mobile Hosts within the network. This amounts to a new sort of routing protocol. We have investigated modifications to the basic Bellman-Ford routing mechanisms, as specified by RIP [5], to make it suitable for a dynamic and self-starting network mechanism as is required by users wishing to utilize ad hoc networks. Our modifications address some of the previous  objections  to the use of Bellman-Ford, related to the poor looping properties of such algorithms in the face of broken links and the resulting time dependent nature of the interconnection topology describing the links between the Mobile Hosts. Finally, we describe the ways in which the basic network-layer routing can be modified to provide MAC-layer support for ad-hoc networks.},

Each mobile host operates as a specialized router, and routes are obtained as needed (i.e., on-demand) with little or no reliance on periodic advertisements. Our new routing algorithm is quite suitable for a dynamic self starting network, as required by users wishing to utilize ad-hoc networks. AODV provides loop-free routes even while repairing broken links. Because the protocol does not require global periodic routing advertisements, the demand on the overall bandwidth available to the mobile nodes is substantially less than in those protocols that do necessitate such advertisements. Nevertheless we can still maintain most of the advantages of basic distance vector routing mechanisms. We show that our algorithm scales to large populations of mobile nodes wishing to form ad-hoc networks. We also include an evaluation methodology and simulation results to verify the operation of our algorithm.},

	abstract = {The 1990s have seen a rapid growth of research interests in mobile ad hoc networking. The infrastructureless and the dynamic nature of these networks demands new set of networking strategies to be implemented in order to provide eﬃcient end-to-end communication. This, along with the diverse application of these networks in many diﬀerent scenarios such as battleﬁeld and disaster recovery, have seen MANETs being researched by many diﬀerent organisations and institutes. MANETs employ the traditional TCP/IP structure to provide end-to-end communication between nodes. However, due to their mobility and the limited resource in wireless networks, each layer in the TCP/IP model require redeﬁnition or modiﬁcations to function eﬃciently in MANETs. One interesting research area in MANET is routing. Routing in the MANETs is a challenging task and has received a tremendous amount of attention from researches. This has led to development of many diﬀerent routing protocols for MANETs, and each author of each proposed protocol argues that the strategy proposed provides an improvement over a number of diﬀerent strategies considered in the literature for a given network scenario. Therefore, it is quite diﬃcult to determine which protocols may perform best under a number of diﬀerent network scenarios, such as increasing node density and traﬃc. In this paper, we provide an overview of a wide range of routing protocols proposed in the literature. We also provide a performance comparison of all routing protocols and suggest which protocols may perform best in large networks.},

Although this objective may be pursued by using Global Navigation Satellite Systems, cheaper and simpler techniques are more suitable for low‐power networks. In this letter, we present a complete experimental data set of Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) measurements collected in different indoor and outdoor environments using LoRa radios. Moreover, we apply simple and power efficient localization algorithms on the obtained data set. The main goal of this work is to share both the experimental data set and the preliminary results on localization among the community.

	abstract = {In this paper, we propose an effective target localization strategy for Internet of Things (IoT) scenarios, where positioning is performed by resource-constrained devices. Target-anchor links may be impaired by Non-Line-Of-Sight (NLOS) communication conditions. In order to derive a feasible IoT-oriented positioning strategy, we rely on the acquisition, at the target, of a sequence of consecutive measurements of the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) of the wireless signals transmitted by the anchors. We then consider a pragmatic approach according to which the NLOS channels are pre-mitigated and “transformed” into equivalent Line-Of-Sight (LOS) channels to estimate more accurately each target-anchor distance. The estimated distances feed “agnostic” localization algorithms, operating as if all links were LOS. We experimentally assess the performance of our approach in indoor (IEEE 802.11-based) and outdoor (Long Term Evolution, LTE-based) scenarios, considering both geometric and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)-based localization algorithms. Even if NLOS mitigation per single communication link is very effective, our results show that, in a given environment, it is possible to derive an “average” NLOS mitigation strategy regardless of the specific position of the target in the given environment. This is crucial to limit the computational complexity at IoT nodes performing localization, yet guaranteeing a relatively high (for IoT scenarios) localization accuracy, especially in an IEEE 802.11-based indoor case (with six anchors). The obtained performance compares favorably (in relative terms) with that obtained with more sophisticated wireless technologies (e.g., Ultra-WideBand, UWB).},

	abstract = {RSSI based localization techniques are effected by environmental factors which cause the RF signalsemitted from transmitter nodes fluctuate in time domain. These variations generate fluctuations on distance calculations and result false object position detection during localization.Smoothing procedures must be applied on distance values either collectively or individually to minimize these fluctuations. In this study,proposed detection system has two main phases. Firstly, calibration of RSSI values with respect to distances and calculation of environmental coefficient for each transmitter.Secondly, position estimation of objects by applyingiterative trilateration on smoothed distance values. A smoothing algorithm is employed to minimize the dynamic fluctuations of RF signals received from each reference transmitter node. Distances between the reference nodes and the objects are calculated by deploying environmental coefficients. Experimental measurements are carried out to measure the sensitivity of the system. Results show that the proposed system can be deployed as a viable position detection system in indoors and outdoors.},
